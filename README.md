# README-Generator

## Description

### Project Motivation & Purpose

I was motivated to create this project to simply the process in making a professional README file. It is easy to forget elements or forget to add certain things, and this project will help to ensure my README is comprehensive and complete.

### What I Learned From This Project

I learned through this project the purpose of a gitignore file. I learned how to write files through a function. I additionally learned how to utilize inquirer to create an object I can pull information from. I also learned how to create a comprehensive walkthrough video to help show the functionality of my code when there is no content to display in the browser. Lastly, I would also say that I learned now to setup the package.json to have things like inquirer work.

## Installation

You will need to make sure you have inquirer downloaded onto your computer for this code to function properly. 

## Usage

If you open your terminal and navigate to where you have this code saved, when you type "node index.js", you will be prompted to answer a series of questions that will help build your README.md file. Upon answering all of the questions, a new README.md file will appear in your repository filled in with all the information you provided through the questions in the terminal. If you opted-in to including an MIT License for your project, the code will also generate a LICENSE file and add content (including a link to the License) to the License section of the README. If you decided not to include a license, no LICENSE file will generate and the license section will be blank.
