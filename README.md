  ## Description

### Project Motivation & Purpose

I was motivated to create this project to simply the process in making a professional README file. It is easy to forget elements or forget to add certain things, and this project will help to ensure my README is comprehensive and complete.

### What I Learned Making This Project

I learned through this project the purpose of a gitignore file. I learned how to write files through a function. I additionally learned how to utilize inquirer to create an object I can pull information from. I also learned how to create a comprehensive walkthrough video to help show the functionality of my code when there is no content to display in the browser. Lastly, I would also say that I learned now to setup the package.json to have things like inquirer work.

If you open your terminal and navigate to where you have this code saved, when you type "node index.js", you will be prompted to answer a series of questions that will help build your README.md file. Upon answering all of the questions, a new README.md file will appear in your repository filled in with all the information you provided through the questions in the terminal.
